Intructions on running HW2:
1.	there are two directory: ./parallel and ./serial, corresponding to serial version of pagerank and parallel version of pagerank
2.	in each directory, using "make" in command line to compile corresponding source file MPI_xxx_pagerank.c into MPI_xxx_pagerank
3.	using following format to run the serial program:
		./MPI_serial_pagerank [graph_file] [graph_split_file]
	for example:
		./MPI_serial_pagerank ./graph/200K-graph.txt ./graph/200K-graph.txt.part.4
	and using following format to run the parallel program:
		mpirun -machinefile [host_file] -np [number_of_processes] ./MPI_parallel_pagerank [graph_file] [graph_split_file]
	for example:
		mpirun -machinefile machine4 -np 4 ./MPI_parallel_pagerank ./graph/200K-graph.txt ./graph/200K-graph.txt.part.4
	Note: for serial program, the [graph_split_file] is only used to count number of nodes
4.	the MPI_parallel_pagerank will generate an output file called pagerank_parallel.result
5.	the MPI_serial_pagerank will generate an output file called pagerank_serial.result
6.	sometimes the [host_file] will causing errors and I haven't figure out why, if happens, please use your [host_file] instead of mine
